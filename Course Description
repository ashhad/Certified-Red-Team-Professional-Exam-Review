The Attacking and Defending Active Directory Lab course by Pentester Academy is a beginner friendly course focussed on the concepts of Active Directory. The course introduces students to the various Active Directory elements and their behaviours. Students are introduced to a number of Active Directory enumeration strategies, attacks, persistence and attack-detection methodologies.

One feature that makes this course special is that throughout the course, there is no external exploit used. No metasploit, or rotten potatoes of any kind. The course revolves around solely and purely on enumeration only. The course uses open source tools and a good amount of attention is given to native active directory module of PowerShell also.

The course contains detailed videos on topics such as, but not limited to Active Directory enumeration, a hint of local privilege escalation, ACL abuses, enumerating and abusing trusts, GPO enumeration, Kerberos and Kerberos based attacks, persistence techniques, detection and defence techniques. Nikhil has done an excellent job of explaining each topic in a very simple and easy to understand way. Most of the topics have practical challenges at their end so that the students can have an on-hands experience of how the attacks work. Whatâ€™s even better is the support these guys provide. I was stuck in a challenge and the team cleared my doubts through detailed conversations over email. The course material also has extra reading materials as references.

The practice lab is a fully patched windows server 2016 environment and emulates the real world scenario very well. As the lab is fully patched there is no possibility of running any open source exploit from the internet

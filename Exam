The exam is a 24 hour exam with another 48 hours for report submission. I cannot provide much details about the exam but I'll not stop myself from saying that it's a very well designed, interesting exam. You need to keep your mind open and enumerate and enumerate and then enumerate some more.

There are 5 machines and you need to get code execution with any privilege on them. Easy. 

My exam experience didn't start well due to things like my laptop crashing, slow internet speed and a few of my favourite scripts not working. I spent a lot of time in getting those to work (despite being told by support not to worry about them) which in turn costed me exam hours. That being said, once you start pwning machines, there is no better feeling. With each machine the confidence grows and you start enjoying the exam. Once you are done I guarantee you will feel very content with yourself. 

Reporting is a task here. The report has to be detailed with references and everything. Think of it as your normal penetration testing report.

Once you submit the report, you get an acknowledgement mail saying that you'll get the results in 48 hours. You can also get a shoutout on twitter from their official handle if you want.
